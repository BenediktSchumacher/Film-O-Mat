4: The Genres
=============

   The genres list exists for the sole purpose of increasing the
   searchability of The Internet Movie Database.

   Genres are the common categories in which we can classify movies,
   there aren't that many of them.

   The name and number of Genres are subject to change over time.

   The Genres:

        Action          Adventure       Adult 		Animation
	Comedy		Crime		Documentary	Drama
	Fantasy		Family		Film-Noir	Horror
	Musical		Mystery		Romance		Sci-Fi
	Short		Thriller	War		Western

   No white space is allowed.  ie "Film Noir" is wrong; its "Film-Noir"
   They start with an uppercase letter.


5: Submission Rules
===================

   How To Add Genres
   -----------------

   Send email to   adds@imdb.com   with the subject "ADD".  Above the
   data you write the word "GENRE" on a line by itself.  "GENRES" also works.

   Under that you write the titles and genres like this:

      <title>|<genre>

   When there are more genres for a movie, simply add them on
   multiple lines under each other, like this:

      <title1>|<genre1>
      <title1>|<genre2>
      <title1>|<genre3>

   When you do it that way, the most important genres should come on top,
   and the least important genres on the bottom.  The order should
   represent how valid the genres are.

   Example:

      To: adds@imdb.com
      Subject: ADD

      GENRES
      Saving Private Ryan (1998)|Drama
      Saving Private Ryan (1998)|War
      Speed (1994)|Action
      Speed (1994)|Thriller
      END

   Some examples on genres you shouldn't add:

        Incorrect genres                   Correct genres
        ----------------                   --------------
        Science Fiction                    Sci-Fi

        Short Documentary                  Documentary
                                         + Short

        Action, Thriller                   Action
                                         + Thriller

        COMEDY                             Comedy

   Also bear in mind that a movie is not necessarily a "Comedy" just
   because there are a few quick remarks or funny jokes in it.  It happens
   too often that movies are registered with incorrect genres.  It's not
   a disaster, but it is annoying for the person renting "Schindler's List"
   to watch a good "Horror" movie.

   If a film contains moments, or aspects of a genre, do NOT put it
   as a main genre.  Instead put the "aspect" as a Keyword separately.
   ie "Ghostbusters (1984)|horror".  Keywords is a separate list.

   GUIDE TO CORRECT GENRES
   -----------------------

   Sometimes genres that don't fit a movie are added, and they should be
   removed as soon as possible.

   To remove a genre from a movie, just put a "!" in front of the line,
   like this (to remove the genre "Horror" from "Schindlers' List":

      GENRES
      !Schindler's List (1993)|Horror
      END

   If the genres in a movie are in a crazy order you can re-order them
   by deleting them first and then adding them in the "correct" order.
